# Documentation about V8 Internals

#### [Ignition: Jump-starting an Interpreter for V8]( https://dynamic-languages-symposium.org/dls-16/program/media/McIlroy_2016_IgnitionJumpStartingAnInterpreterForV8_Dls.pdf) by Ross McIlroy

A lengthy and detailed slide deck describing the internal operations of the Ignition byte code interpreter. Describes many of the data structures used within Ignition, as well as how they relate to the source code, the V8 byte code, and the target assembly language.

Not an easy document to start with, but does cover a lot of the internal detail with excellent diagrams and examples.
